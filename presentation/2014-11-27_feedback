GENERAL
	- top right titles : increase gray level

INTRO
	- intro too general, do not spend to much time on it
	- short the introduction to save time for more results
	- add new slide after 18 : Why are we doing this research? What is the needs? Explain that it is not obvious because previous work on document analysis are different in terms of ... semi-structured, (Dimos sais that it is listed in the manuscript...)

CONTRIBUTION
	- introduce by explaining the advantage and disadvantages of the 3 approaches, why 3, which one first... (sequential in literature, limitation, advantage/inconvenient of independant, same for knowledge-driven (current trends)) "recover the main drawback of the first approach: error propagation", show where are ALL the contributions of the thesis
	- a lot of different process, keep flowchart in the corner
	- flowcharts: make lines thicker
	23 - mention scene text do not let open question, explain why it is not appropriate here, complete REF
	37 - merge panel/text in flowcharts because simultaneous
	49 - insist Etext because it is THE contribution
	65 - no black cross -> remove the chart, in the following slides

	- intro each contribution, explain why we made this choice, compared to/position to the literature
	51 - change panel OR explain how to filter
	- add more results maybe at the end of each contribution (2 slides)
	- merge 64-65 processing sequence

CONCLUSION
	- missing my personnal feeling about the progress we did, are we closer to solve the problem? Give between 1-5 stars to each process before and after this 3-year work -> highlight all my contributions without forgeting any, even those from method 2 ;)

MISC
- compare effective # pages last/current slideshow -> time
- arrange process loop arrows and text
- publication list
- Thank you splash (animated gif/video?)
- print notes
- is this really segmentation? A question from Su
