GENERAL
	- top right titles : increase gray level

INTRO
- intro too general, do not spend to much time on it
- short the introduction to save time for more results
- add new slide after 18 : Why are we doing this research? What is the needs? Explain it is not obvious because previous work on document analysis are different in terms of ... semi-structured, (Dimos sais that it is listed in the manuscript...)

CONTRIBUTION
- a lot of different process, keep flowchart in the corner
- flowcharts: make lines thiker
23 - mention scene text to not let open question, explain why it is not appropriate here, complete REF
37 - merge panel/text in flowcharts because simultaneous
49 - insist Etext because it is THE contribution
65 - no black cross -> remove the chart, in the following slides
- explain advantage and disadvantages
- intro each contribution, explain why we made this choice, compared to/position to the literature
51 - change panel OR explain how to filter
- add more results maybe at the end of each contribution (2 slides)

CONCLUSION
- missing my personnal feeling about the progress we did, are we closer to solve the problem? Give between 1-5 stars to each process before and after this 3-year work -> highlight all my contributions without forgeting any, even those from method 2 ;)

MISC
- is this really segmentation? A question from Su
